# Exalted Map of Creation

A SVG-based map of Creation for White Wolf's 2nd edition Exalted. This uses information from [stephenls'](http://hd42.de/rpg_exalted_maps.html) map of creation.

The style of the map is inspired by the [World Reference Atlas](http://www.dk.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781409376392,00.html?/Reference_World_Atlas_DK_Publishing) published by [Dorling Kindersley](http://www.dk.co.uk/).

The map itself was created using [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) on a 64-bit Linux. There is a possibility it cannot be opened on Windows or with non-Inkscape editors. In that case, please use the SVG files in the `Additional` folder as needed.

## Layers

The SVG image has multiple layers so certain features can be hidden. This also lets you create customizations, such as a different set of celestial gates (our gaming group used 108 with each Sidereal having exactly one gate).

* Frame
* Boundaries
	* Kingdoms
* Geomancy
	* Raksha
	* Celestial Gates
	* Demenses
	* Shadowlands
* Constructions
	* Cities
* Grid
* Terra
* Aqua

# Additional Formats

In the `Additional` folder, there are versions of the map that may be better suited for some purposes. All of these files are based on the top-level `Creation.svg`.
